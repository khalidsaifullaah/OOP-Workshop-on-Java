# OOP-Workshop-on-Java
This repository contains the codes and assignments submitted by the students participated in OOP Workshop presented by [UIU App Forum](https://appf.uiu.ac.bd/) and instructed by me.

- ### Initialization:

  Use the following command to set the repository in your local machine

  `git clone https://github.com/khalidsaifullaah/OOP-Workshop-on-Java.git`

*Note: You don't have to use this command every time you submit an assignment, doing it once is enough*


- ### Submitting assignments:

  Use the following commands one by one

  `git pull origin master`

  `git checkout -b <your ID>`; for example in my case - `git checkout -b 011172043`

  `git add .`

  `git commit -m "1st problem solved"`

  `git push origin <your ID>`

Voila! your assignment has been added to the repo, you can check it on GitHub now...
